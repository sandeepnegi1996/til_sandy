## Java Interview Questions 

Q1. jdk vs jre vs jvm
- jd k is a development kit , it contains jre and inside jre there is jvm , jdk also contains other bunch of tools such as , javac
- javadoc, jar,

2. JRE :- java runtime environment : this is the minimum requirement to run the code , if we have a java code we can run using jre , we don't need 
  jdk to run the code
  
3. JVM :- actual Java virtual machine which will basically run the code , it will take the bytecode and run it .

Q2. Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java.

- public : access modifier means who can access this , since it is public it can be accessed by any of the classes in any of the packages there are other access modifier also like private,protected ,default

- static  👍 means it is associated with class , we can directly call this without even creating object of the class.
- void : it is a return type means the method will not return anything.
- main : it is method , which will be searched by the JVM this is where the execution of the code will start.
- String args[] -> basically an array of string which is passed as method argument.

Q3. Why Java is platform independent?
- Since the bytecode that is generated it can be ran on any system, i have tested this in windows and linux not in mac.


Q5. What are wrapper classes in Java?
- Wrapper claases are used to wrap the primitive data type into Refrence type, we have wrapper classes for each of the primitive data type.
